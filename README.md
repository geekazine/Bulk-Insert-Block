This plugin will list your posts, then give you an option to insert a block into the post. I made this because I needed the functionality. 
You can use it at your discression. there is no support for this plugin, and you waive any responsibilities as I cannot test it out on all blocks. 

Some blocks work, some don't. Mostly blocks that don't require additional input. 

- core/paragraph does not work. I have it set up for a possible update in the future.

  #To Install#

  Sinply download the "bulk-insert-block.zip" file, then open in Wordpress - Plugins - Add Plugin.
  The unzipped file is also there if you want to play.
